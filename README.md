# Simulated login

This is an app where you can login with different users and it shows the last time the user accessed.

The login is simulated with Promises and `setTimeout`.

Registered users are mocked in `data/registeredUsers.json`

The user logged and the time when was logged persists in LocalStorage.

## Tools and technologies

This is a React project, implementing hooks.

The errors validations are made by `react-hooks-form` library.

Tests are made with `Jest` and `Enzyme`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

### `npm lint`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
